# Portofolio
The time has come for my portofolio projects 
My first project, in addition to my two-year software engineer program, involved continuous progression through FreeCodeCamp, where I focused on gaining more skills in front-end development. One of my initial self-made projects was creating a survey form. Here it is after completing the course and revisiting it for improvements.
