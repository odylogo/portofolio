                <p>
                  Maria Salomea Skłodowska-Curie , known simply as Marie Curie,
                  was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who
                  conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the
                  first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win a
                  Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win a Nobel Prize in
                  two scientific fields. Her husband, Pierre Curie, was a
                  co-winner of her first Nobel Prize, making them the first-ever
                  married couple to win the Nobel Prize and launching the Curie
                  family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was, in 1906, the
                  first woman to become a professor at the University of
                  Paris.[5]
                </p>
                <p>
                  She was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of
                  Poland, part of the Russian Empire. She studied at Warsaw's
                  clandestine Flying University and began her practical
                  scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891, aged 24, she followed
                  her elder sister Bronisława to study in Paris, where she
                  earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent
                  scientific work. In 1895 she married the French physicist
                  Pierre Curie, and she shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics
                  with him and with the physicist Henri Becquerel for their
                  pioneering work developing the theory of "radioactivity"—a
                  term she coined.[6][7] In 1906 Pierre Curie died in a Paris
                  street accident. Marie won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry
                  for her discovery of the elements polonium and radium, using
                  techniques she invented for isolating radioactive isotopes.
                  Under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted
                  into the treatment of neoplasms by the use of radioactive
                  isotopes. She founded the Curie Institute in Paris in 1920,
                  and the Curie Institute in Warsaw in 1932; both remain major
                  medical research centres. During World War I she developed
                  mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field
                  hospitals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While a French citizen, Marie Skłodowska Curie, who used both
                  surnames,[8][9] never lost her sense of Polish identity. She
                  taught her daughters the Polish language and took them on
                  visits to Poland.[10] She named the first chemical element she
                  discovered polonium, after her native country.[a] Marie Curie
                  died in 1934, aged 66, at the Sancellemoz sanatorium in Passy
                  (Haute-Savoie), France, of aplastic anemia likely from
                  exposure to radiation in the course of her scientific research
                  and in the course of her radiological work at field hospitals
                  during World War I.[12] In addition to her Nobel Prizes, she
                  received numerous other honours and tributes; in 1995 she
                  became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the
                  Paris Pantheon,[13] and Poland declared 2011 the Year of Marie
                  Curie during the International Year of Chemistry. She is the
                  subject of numerous biographical works.

                <h3>Early years</h3>
                <p>
                  Maria Skłodowska was born in Warsaw, in Congress Poland in the
                  Russian Empire, on 7 November 1867, the fifth and youngest
                  child of well-known teachers Bronisława, née Boguska, and
                  Władysław Skłodowski.[14] The elder siblings of Maria
                  (nicknamed Mania) were Zofia (born 1862, nicknamed Zosia),
                  Józef [pl] (born 1863, nicknamed Józio), Bronisława (born
                  1865, nicknamed Bronia) and Helena (born 1866, nicknamed
                  Hela).[15][16]
                </p>
                <p>
                  On both the paternal and maternal sides, the family had lost
                  their property and fortunes through patriotic involvements in
                  Polish national uprisings aimed at restoring Poland's
                  independence (the most recent had been the January Uprising of
                  1863–65).[17] This condemned the subsequent generation,
                  including Maria and her elder siblings, to a difficult
                  struggle to get ahead in life.[17] Maria's paternal
                  grandfather, Józef Skłodowski [pl], had been principal of the
                  Lublin primary school attended by Bolesław Prus,[18] who
                  became a leading figure in Polish literature.[19]
                </p>
                <p>
                  Władysław Skłodowski taught mathematics and physics, subjects
                  that Maria was to pursue, and was also director of two Warsaw
                  gymnasia (secondary schools) for boys. After Russian
                  authorities eliminated laboratory instruction from the Polish
                  schools, he brought much of the laboratory equipment home and
                  instructed his children in its use.[15] He was eventually
                  fired by his Russian supervisors for pro-Polish sentiments and
                  forced to take lower-paying posts; the family also lost money
                  on a bad investment and eventually chose to supplement their
                  income by lodging boys in the house.[15] Maria's mother
                  Bronisława operated a prestigious Warsaw boarding school for
                  girls; she resigned from the position after Maria was
                  born.[15] She died of tuberculosis in May 1878, when Maria was
                  ten years old.[15] Less than three years earlier, Maria's
                  oldest sibling, Zofia, had died of typhus contracted from a
                  boarder.[15] Maria's father was an atheist, her mother a
                  devout Catholic.[20] The deaths of Maria's mother and sister
                  caused her to give up Catholicism and become agnostic.[21]

                  In late 1891, she left Poland for France.[25] In Paris, Maria
                  (or Marie, as she would be known in France) briefly found
                  shelter with her sister and brother-in-law before renting a
                  garret closer to the university, in the Latin Quarter, and
                  proceeding with her studies of physics, chemistry, and
                  mathematics at the University of Paris, where she enrolled in
                  late 1891.[26][27] She subsisted on her meagre resources,
                  keeping herself warm during cold winters by wearing all the
                  clothes she had. She focused so hard on her studies that she
                  sometimes forgot to eat.[27] Skłodowska studied during the day
                  and tutored evenings, barely earning her keep. In 1893, she
                  was awarded a degree in physics and began work in an
                  industrial laboratory of Gabriel Lippmann. Meanwhile, she
                  continued studying at the University of Paris and with the aid
                  of a fellowship she was able to earn a second degree in 1894.

                    In 1895, Wilhelm Röntgen discovered the existence of X-rays,
                    though the mechanism behind their production was not yet
                    understood.[30] In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that
                    uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their
                    penetrating power.[30] He demonstrated that this radiation,
                    unlike phosphorescence, did not depend on an external source
                    of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium
                    itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries, Curie
                    decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of
                    research for a thesis.

                    She used an innovative technique to investigate samples.
                    Fifteen years earlier, her husband and his brother had
                    developed a version of the electrometer, a sensitive device
                    for measuring electric charge.[30] Using her husband's
                    electrometer, she discovered that uranium rays caused the
                    air around a sample to conduct electricity. Using this
                    technique, her first result was the finding that the
                    activity of the uranium compounds depended only on the
                    quantity of uranium present.[30] She hypothesized that the
                    radiation was not the outcome of some interaction of
                    molecules but must come from the atom itself.[30] This
                    hypothesis was an important step in disproving the
                    assumption that atoms were indivisible.

                    In 1897, her daughter Irène was born. To support her family,
                    Curie began teaching at the École Normale Supérieure.[25]
                    The Curies did not have a dedicated laboratory; most of
                    their research was carried out in a converted shed next to
                    ESPCI.[25] The shed, formerly a medical school dissecting
                    room, was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof.[32]
                    They were unaware of the deleterious effects of radiation
                    exposure attendant on their continued unprotected work with
                    radioactive substances. ESPCI did not sponsor her research,
                    but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and
                    mining companies and from various organizations and
                    governments.
